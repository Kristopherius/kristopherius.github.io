  aboutMe:
    "I was born in 1998 Poland, raised in Belgium, living in the Netherlands. I recently graduated Game Design at Hanze University of Groningen. Ever since I've gotten my hands on the first computer in our family, when I was 4 or 5, I was stuck to it forever. Over the course of my life I have played a lot of games, and from that passion I learned to value the hard work and dedication that goes into the art of the craft.",
